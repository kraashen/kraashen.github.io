Applications were downloaded on 2014-04-15 but I wanted to take time for the developers of those applications who had outdated OpenSSL components to respond to me first before publishing the results. Best before date was calculated as Kasper Kyllönen collected them in his study based on the oldest OpenSSL version used in the tool binary in question [3].\nIt can be seen that most of the applications are not using OpenSSL, but then again there are some cases with ad components that are not Google’s own. These ad components included libraries such as tapjoy, inmobi, and mopub, one of which was within an Antivirus application and other was a common flashlight app. I took the digging a bit deeper and focused also on what other components those applications needed: common apps included e.g. google-wallet, google-chromecast, social media apis, google-drive, and google-fitness libraries which are in some cases out of scope of the use of the application in my opinion.\nDiscussion and thoughts What our applications are made of is one fundamental basis to start to understand what kind of impact the components that we use have in our software. This does not directly indicate vulnerability analysis but it comes as a part of this. BOMtotal has leveraged the work to dissect and dive into what the apps we use and have developed are using, and can plan and react if we notice something out of order - even in our own applications we develop.\nCredits and thanks Thanks to Ossi Herrala and Antti Tönkyrä for assisting in reviewing my analysis, and all security teams of developers and services who include OpenSSL in their software who responded in a polite and quick manner to my reports.\nAs of writing this blog post, those parties responded to the notification within 48 hours I sent about OpenSSL to them.
