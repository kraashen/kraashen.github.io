      <description>Stuck on a situation with multiple files with many changes but want to commit some part of the changes as separate commits?
Git patch feature to the rescue! There are two quick options: git add --patch and patching interactively via git add -i . Each have some differences.
With git add you get the interactive git terminal to go through your unstaged, staged, and untracked files, as well as to call patch (5) to interactively go through the unstaged changed from files.</description>
