> Software developer and systems engineer from cloud to baremetal. Also a nerd and enthusiastic about tech, gaming, and science. Interests include sourdough baking, infosec, software, Linux, and everything open source. In this blog are some of my journeys and thoughts of programming, eternal procrastination and pet projects, and technology in general. Maybe also something off-topic.
