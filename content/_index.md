> Full-stack developer and devops engineer. Also a geek, a gaming and tech enthusiast. Into sourdough baking, infosec, backend development, and everything FOSS. In this blog are some of my journeys and thoughts of programming, eternal procrastrination and pet projects, Linux, and technology in general. Maybe also something off-topic.
