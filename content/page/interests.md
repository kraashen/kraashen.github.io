### Sourdough Baking

When I was a kid, I used to spend a lot of time in our kitchen.
Scent of fresh barley bread was often lingering in the air.
Though, the baking hobby was pretty much on-off
until around 2016 when I got into sourdough baking.

Cultivating and nourishing a living sourdough starter culture
and diving deep into the scientific side of baking during
2020 hooked me completely. Online forums and social media
opened up a whole new world of baking with so many warm and friendly
people, communities, as well as books, and new knowledge. Many
of the new techniques, tips, trends, and everything related
nowadays come from meeting online and IRL, as well as sharing
thoughts and experiences.

There are so many exciting things to experiment
and study with different baking styles
and techniques in different culinary contexts. How
variables such as pH, temperature in the kitchen around
the year, and flours and their quality affect the
whole process from the beginning to the end product. 

Trying out new methods and
ingredients as well as to find new flavors is simply fun.
Sometimes on the other hand, it's also nice to enjoy doing
a casual everyday bread and pizza with no hifi-ninja-baking-fu
attached to it. It can be fun, casual, exact, and with a
touch of rustique. There is a rich versatility in baking
around the world to learn from and to try out! Pizzas ranging from
Neapolitan-style to New York and Roman styles, country
loafs to whole rye breads and brioches...

Hopefully, I could someday have that own wood-fired oven
to bake the delicious Northern-Finland-style barley
bread and pizzas in.
