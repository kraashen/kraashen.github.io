### Sourdough Baking

When I was a kid, I used to spend a lot of time in our kitchen.
Scent of fresh barley bread was often lingering in the air.
Though, the baking hobby was pretty much on-off for along time,
until around 2016, when I got into sourdough baking.

Cultivating and nourishing a living sourdough starter culture
and diving deep into the scientific side of baking during
2020 hooked me completely. Online forums and other social media platforms
opened up a whole new world of baking, meeting so many new warm and friendly
people, chat with communities, as well as finding books, and new knowledge. Many
of the techniques, tips, trends, and everything related
nowadays come from sharing thoughts and experiences online and IRL.

There are so many exciting things to experiment
and study with different baking styles
and techniques. Studying, how variables such as pH,
temperature in the kitchen around the year, and flours
and their quality affect the whole process from the beginning
to the end product. 

Trying out new methods and
ingredients as well as to find new flavors was simply fun and addicting.
Sometimes on the other hand, it's also nice to enjoy doing
a casual everyday bread and pizza with no hifi-ninja-baking-fu
attached to it. It can be fun, casual, exact, and with a
touch of rustique. There is a rich versatility in baking
around the world to learn from and to try out! Pizzas ranging from
Neapolitan-style to New York and Roman styles, country
loafs to whole rye breads and brioches...

Hopefully, I could someday have that own wood-fired oven
to bake the delicious Northern-Finland-style barley
bread and pizzas in.
