[Learning how to ask better questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/) is fundamental
to be able to learn to solve hard problems. Curiosity is a way of life that's worth trying to keep.
Both are hard, but definitely worth it. It's cool though, life's a marathon.
Hopefully with lots of great things along the way.

## Non-tech Stuff

### Baking

When I was a kid, I used to spend a lot of time in the kitchen.
During winters, the wood-fired brick oven was heated many times a week
to keep the house warm. The scent of fresh barley bread was often lingering in the air.
After childhood, the baking hobby was pretty much an on-off thing for a long time
until around 2016, when I came across into sourdough baking.

Taking care of a sourdough starter culture and learning the crafty and engineering
side of baking was addicting. Internet along with all the scenes and forums
were great for sharing experiences with other enthusiasts. There's much to learn every time.

What then? There are exciting things to experiment and study with:
* different baking styles and techniques around the world
* variables affecting the baking process (pH, temperature in the kitchen around the year, and ingredients and their quality 
* order of the ingredients in the process and reasons for this

Many things affects the whole process from the beginning to the end product.
Simply trying out new methods and ingredients to find new flavors is fun.

Sometimes, it's also nice to just enjoy doing a casual everyday bread
and pizza with no hifi-ninja-baking-fu attached to it.

It can be fun, casual, exact, and with a touch of rustique.
There is a rich versatility in baking around the world to learn from and to try out!
Pizzas ranging from Neapolitan-style to New York and Roman styles, country
loafs to whole rye breads and brioches, milk loafs and so on...

Someday, the dream is to have an own wood-fired oven to bake
Northern-Finland-style barley bread and pizzas in.
